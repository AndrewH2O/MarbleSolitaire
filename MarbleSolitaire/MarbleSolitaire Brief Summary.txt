GameViewModel2 (GVM) uses GameAttributes and an IErrorLog 

Focusing on the game as the error logging is rudimentary and its contract is easily satisfied and cross cutting concerns is not really relevent here.

The GVM Uses GameAttributes to GetBoard (in our case a SquareBoard although it could be used as an extensibility point to work with other shapes) and a start position. The GameAttributes provides the start position for the board; This makes testing for different start positions possible.
